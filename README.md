# digikeeper-bot
Digikeeper bot is based on golang library `telego`.
It was created as a pet-project to demonstrate session and stateful-protocol based approaches in telegram bot development.
To showcase the differences, there are two types of interactions:
- `/command`-s (similar to HTTP-handlers)
- keyboard actions (FSM + Session related)

Current features that you can easily copy-paste to your bot:
- `/cancel` command to erase current state in session
- `/help` command is autogenerated
- `UserStateMiddleware` -- middleware to fetch session by userID (with in-memory mock implementation)
